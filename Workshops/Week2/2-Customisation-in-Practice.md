# Customisation in Practice

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Format:** Presentation with demonstrations  
**Objective:** See how the customisation tools from Session 1 (instruction files, prompt files, and custom agents) improve real developer workflows including documentation generation, code refinement, and debugging.

In Session 1 you learned the three pillars of Copilot customisation. This session shows how those tools make everyday tasks, such as generating documentation, refining suggestions, and debugging, more consistent and effective. Throughout this session, look for the **Customisation Tip** callouts showing how instruction files, prompt files, or custom agents can automate or standardise each technique.

## Part 1: Documentation Generation with Copilot

Documentation is essential for maintainable code, but often neglected due to time constraints. Copilot can significantly reduce the effort required to create comprehensive documentation. By combining Copilot with **instruction files** that define your documentation standards and **prompt files** that encode reusable documentation templates, you can generate consistent, team-aligned docs every time.

---

### Types of Documentation Copilot Can Generate

| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Inline Comments** | Single-line explanations within code | Complex logic, non-obvious decisions |
| **JSDoc/Docstrings** | Structured function documentation | All public functions and methods |
| **README Files** | Project overviews and setup guides | Every repository |
| **API Documentation** | Endpoint descriptions and examples | REST/GraphQL APIs |
| **Architecture Docs** | System design explanations | Complex systems |
| **Code Explanations** | Detailed walkthrough of existing code | Onboarding, knowledge sharing |

---

### Generating Function Documentation

#### Using Inline Suggestions

Type `/**` above a function to trigger documentation generation:

```javascript
/**
 * // Copilot will suggest documentation here
 */
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time, n) {
  return principal * Math.pow((1 + rate / n), n * time);
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates compound interest over a specified period.
 * @param {number} principal - The initial amount of money
 * @param {number} rate - The annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
 * @param {number} time - The number of years
 * @param {number} n - The number of times interest is compounded per year
 * @returns {number} The final amount after compound interest
 * @example
 * // Calculate 5% annual interest compounded monthly for 10 years on $1000
 * calculateCompoundInterest(1000, 0.05, 10, 12); // Returns ~1647.01
 */
```

#### Using Copilot Chat

For existing undocumented code, use Ask mode:

**Prompt:**
> "Generate comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all functions in this file, including parameter types, return values, exceptions thrown, and usage examples."

> **Customisation Tip:** Save this as a **prompt file** (`.github/prompts/generate-docs.prompt.md`) so the whole team can trigger it with `/generate-docs` instead of retyping the prompt each time.

---

### Generating README Files

#### Quick README Generation

**Prompt:**
> "Generate a README.md for this project that includes: project title and description, features list, installation instructions, usage examples, API documentation (if applicable), contributing guidelines, and license information."

#### Example: Book Inventory System README

**Prompt:**
> "Create a README.md for a Book Inventory Management System built with Node.js. Include sections for setup, usage, API endpoints, and testing."

**Sample Output:**
```markdown
# Book Inventory Management System

A Node.js application for managing book inventories with add, search, and list functionality.

## Features

- Add books with title, author, genre, and publication year
- Search books by title or genre (case-insensitive)
- Duplicate detection based on book title
- Persistent storage using JSON files or local storage

## Installation

npm install

## Usage

const { addBook, searchBooks, listBooks } = require('./src/inventory');

// Add a new book
addBook(inventory, {
  title: 'The Great Gatsby',
  author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
  genre: 'Fiction',
  publicationYear: 1925
});

// Search for books
const results = searchBooks(inventory, 'gatsby');

## Testing

npm test

## License

MIT
```

---

### Code Explanation Documentation

Use Copilot to explain complex code for documentation purposes:

**Prompt:**
> "Explain the logic in this addBook function, especially how duplicates are handled. Format the explanation as a documentation comment that could be added above the function."

**Another Prompt:**
> "Describe how this searchBooks function works and how it filters by title or genre. Write it as internal documentation for other developers."

---

### API Documentation Generation

For REST APIs, generate endpoint documentation:

**Prompt:**
> "Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for this Express router file. Include request/response schemas, status codes, and example payloads."

**Sample Output:**
```yaml
/api/books:
  post:
    summary: Add a new book to the inventory
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            required:
              - title
              - author
              - genre
            properties:
              title:
                type: string
                example: "The Great Gatsby"
              author:
                type: string
                example: "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
              genre:
                type: string
                example: "Fiction"
              publicationYear:
                type: integer
                example: 1925
    responses:
      201:
        description: Book created successfully
      400:
        description: Invalid input or duplicate book
```

> **Customisation Tip:** Create a **custom agent** (`.github/agents/docs-writer.agent.md`) with read-only tools (`codebase`, `search`) and instructions that enforce your documentation standards. This gives the team a one-click "Generate docs" persona that never modifies production code.

---

## Part 2: Refining Copilot Suggestions

Not every suggestion from Copilot is production-ready. Learning to refine and improve suggestions is key to effective use. **Instruction files** help here by encoding your team's coding standards. When Copilot has access to an instruction file that specifies error handling patterns, naming conventions, and code style, its first suggestion is already closer to production quality, meaning fewer refinement cycles.

---

### The Review-Refine-Iterate Cycle

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Generate   │────▶│   Review    │────▶│   Refine    │
│  Suggestion │     │   Output    │     │   Prompt    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       ▲                                       │
       │                                       │
       └───────────────────────────────────────┘
                    Iterate
```

### What to Look For When Reviewing

| Aspect | Questions to Ask | Action | Example (Incorrect) | Prompt to Fix | Corrected Output |
|--------|------------------|--------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Correctness** | Does it work? Any logic errors? | Test and debug | `for (i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++)` | "Fix the off-by-one error in this loop" | `for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)` |
| **Completeness** | Are edge cases handled? | Add missing scenarios | `function getUser(id) { return users[id].name; }` | "Add null checking for when user doesn't exist" | `function getUser(id) { return users[id]?.name ?? 'Unknown'; }` |
| **Security** | Any vulnerabilities? Input validation? | Add security measures | `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + id` | "Refactor to use parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection" | `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @id"` |
| **Performance** | Will it scale? Any inefficiencies? | Optimise as needed | `arr.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.id)` called in loop | "Optimise this to avoid repeated filtering" | Cache result: `const activeIds = arr.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.id)` |
| **Readability** | Is it clear? Well-named? | Refactor for clarity | `const x = users.filter(u => u.a > 5);` | "Rename variables to be more descriptive" | `const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.activityScore > 5);` |
| **Standards** | Follows team conventions? | Align with guidelines | `const user_name = get_user_name();` | "Update to use consistent camelCase naming" | `const userName = getUserName();` |

---

### Refinement Techniques

#### 1. Ask for Improvements

After receiving a suggestion, ask Copilot to improve it:

**Initial Prompt:**
> "Write a function to search for books in an inventory"

**Refinement Prompts:**
> "Now optimise this for performance when searching through 10,000+ books"

> "Add input validation to handle null, undefined, and empty string searches"

> "Refactor to follow our team's error handling pattern with try-catch and standardised error objects"

> **Customisation Tip:** If your team always uses the same error handling pattern, add it to an **instruction file** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Copilot will then apply it automatically, removing the need to state it in every prompt.

#### 2. Request Alternatives

**Prompt:**
> "Can you suggest a more efficient algorithm for this search function? Show me 2-3 alternative approaches with their trade-offs."

#### 3. Add Missing Features Incrementally

**Prompt:**
> "Modify the searchBooks function to also filter by author, not just title and genre."

**Prompt:**
> "Update the addBook function to include an optional field for publication year with validation that it's a valid year between 1450 and the current year."

---

### Example: Progressive Refinement

**Step 1 - Basic Generation:**
```javascript
// Initial prompt: "Write a function to add books to an array"
function addBook(books, book) {
  books.push(book);
}
```

**Step 2 - Add Validation:**
```javascript
// Refinement: "Add input validation and duplicate checking"
function addBook(books, book) {
  if (!book.title || !book.author) {
    throw new Error('Title and author are required');
  }
  
  if (books.some(b => b.title === book.title)) {
    throw new Error('Book already exists');
  }
  
  books.push(book);
}
```

**Step 3 - Improve Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Refinement: "Return a result object instead of throwing errors"
function addBook(books, book) {
  if (!book.title || !book.author) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Title and author are required' };
  }
  
  const exists = books.some(
    b => b.title.toLowerCase() === book.title.toLowerCase()
  );
  
  if (exists) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Book already exists' };
  }
  
  books.push(book);
  return { success: true, data: book };
}
```

**Step 4 - Add Documentation:**
```javascript
// Refinement: "Add JSDoc documentation and make it production-ready"
/**
 * Adds a new book to the inventory with duplicate detection.
 * @param {Array<Object>} books - The current book inventory
 * @param {Object} book - The book to add
 * @param {string} book.title - The book's title (required)
 * @param {string} book.author - The book's author (required)
 * @param {string} [book.genre] - The book's genre (optional)
 * @param {number} [book.publicationYear] - Year of publication (optional)
 * @returns {Object} Result object with success status and data/error
 * @example
 * const result = addBook(inventory, { title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' });
 * if (result.success) {
 *   console.log('Added:', result.data);
 * }
 */
function addBook(books, book) {
  // Validate required fields
  if (!book?.title?.trim() || !book?.author?.trim()) {
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: 'Title and author are required and cannot be empty' 
    };
  }
  
  // Check for duplicates (case-insensitive)
  const normalizedTitle = book.title.toLowerCase().trim();
  const exists = books.some(
    b => b.title.toLowerCase().trim() === normalizedTitle
  );
  
  if (exists) {
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: `Book titled "${book.title}" already exists` 
    };
  }
  
  // Add the book
  const newBook = {
    ...book,
    title: book.title.trim(),
    author: book.author.trim(),
    addedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  books.push(newBook);
  return { success: true, data: newBook };
}
```

### Scoping Suggestions for Maintainability

#### Single Responsibility Principle

When Copilot generates large functions, ask it to break them down:

**Prompt:**
> "Refactor this function to follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Break it into smaller, focused functions."

#### Modular Architecture

**Prompt:**
> "Reorganise this code into a modular structure with separate files for models, controllers, and utilities. Show me the file structure and the code for each file."

#### Removing Code Duplication

**Prompt:**
> "Identify any duplicate or similar code patterns and refactor them into reusable utility functions."

---

### Debugging with Copilot

When code doesn't work as expected, use Copilot to debug:

> **Customisation Tip:** Create a **prompt file** (`.github/prompts/debug-analyse.prompt.md`) that includes your team's standard debugging checklist (log format, breakpoint strategy, common pitfalls). Invoke it with `/debug-analyse` to get consistent, thorough analysis every time.

#### Identify Issues

**Prompt:**
> "Analyse this function and identify any potential bugs, edge cases, or logical errors."

#### Fix Specific Errors

**Prompt:**
> "I'm getting 'TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined' when calling searchBooks. What could cause this and how do I fix it?"

#### Alternative Approaches

**Prompt:**
> "Research alternative error-handling strategies for saving data to local storage. Which approach would be most robust?"

---

## Part 3: Team Customisation Workflow

For a team, customisation works best as a small, version-controlled pack rather than a one-off prompt. The goal is to make Copilot understand team conventions, keep agentic work reviewable, and make common workflows repeatable.

### Recommended Customisation Pack

| Item | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Repository instructions | Always-on standards for the project | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| File-scoped instructions | Rules for tests, APIs, docs, or infrastructure files | `.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md` |
| Prompt files | Repeatable tasks invoked with `/` | `.github/prompts/security-review.prompt.md` |
| Custom agents | Role-specific behaviour and tool access | `.github/agents/planner.agent.md` |
| Agent skills | Packaged domain workflow guidance | `skills/release-notes/SKILL.md` |
| Diagnostics habit | Verify what customisations applied | `/troubleshoot`, Agent Debug, or customisation diagnostics |

### Plan-First Workflow

Use this workflow for changes that touch multiple files or carry risk:

1. Run `/init` or review existing instructions so Copilot understands the repository.
2. Ask the Plan agent to analyse the request, identify likely files, list risks, and define acceptance criteria.
3. Review the plan with the learner or team before allowing edits.
4. Hand the approved plan to Agent mode or Copilot CLI with clear permission boundaries.
5. Run tests, linters, or manual checks, then ask Copilot to summarise changes and residual risks.
6. Use `/troubleshoot` or Agent Debug if Copilot ignored a customisation or selected unexpected tools.

**Prompt:**
> "Plan how to add CSV export for the inventory report. Use repository instructions and `#codebase`. Identify files likely to change, risks, tests to add or run, and manual verification steps. Do not edit files yet."

**Follow-up Prompt:**
> "Implement the approved plan. Ask before running package installation, external network calls, or commands that change deployment state. After edits, run the relevant tests or explain why they cannot run."

> **Customisation Tip:** Keep planning and review agents read-only where possible. Give implementation agents only the tools they need for the workflow.

## Part 4: Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Documentation Challenge

Take an undocumented function and generate complete documentation:

1. **Start with this code:**
```javascript
function processData(input, options) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    if (options.filter && !options.filter(input[i])) continue;
    const processed = options.transform ? options.transform(input[i]) : input[i];
    results.push(processed);
  }
  return options.sort ? results.sort(options.sort) : results;
}
```

2. **Use Copilot to:**
   - Generate JSDoc documentation
   - Add inline comments explaining the logic
   - Create usage examples

### Exercise 2: Refinement Practice

Starting with a basic function, progressively refine it:

1. **Initial Prompt:**
   > "Write a function to list all books in an inventory"

2. **Refinements:**
   - Add pagination support
   - Add sorting by title, author, or date added
   - Add filtering by genre
   - Ensure it handles empty inventories gracefully

### Exercise 3: Code Explanation

Use the code explanation prompts with sample code:

1. **Prompt:**
   > "Explain the logic used in the addBook function, especially how duplicates are handled."

2. **Prompt:**
   > "Suggest ways to optimise the addBook function for performance when handling large inventories."

3. **Prompt:**
   > "Identify any potential edge cases in the searchBooks function and how they could be handled."

### Exercise 4: Test Generation and Refinement

Generate tests and refine them:

1. **Prompt:**
   > "Write unit tests using Jest for the addBook function to ensure it handles duplicates correctly."

2. **Prompt:**
   > "Generate Jest test cases for the searchBooks function, including cases for no results and multiple matches."

3. **Refinement:**
   > "Generate additional test cases for edge scenarios, like searching with an empty query or adding books with missing fields."

### Exercise 5: Customisation Pack Review

Create or inspect a small customisation pack:

1. **Repository Instructions:**
   > "Review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and identify any missing project conventions that would improve generated code."

2. **Prompt File:**
   > "Create a reusable prompt file for reviewing generated tests. Include checks for weak assertions, over-mocking, missing edge cases, and test names."

3. **Custom Agent:**
   > "Create a read-only planning agent that produces implementation plans, acceptance criteria, and validation steps without editing files."

4. **Skill:**
   > "Draft a `SKILL.md` for a release-note writing workflow. Include when to use it, required context, output format, and validation checks."

5. **Diagnostics:**
   > "Troubleshoot why the repository instructions were not applied to the last response. List which customisations were used and what to adjust."

## Best Practices Summary

### Documentation Generation

| Practice | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Document as you go** | Generate docs when writing new functions | "Generate JSDoc for this new validateEmail function" |
| **Use structured formats** | JSDoc, docstrings, OpenAPI for consistency | Use `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` tags consistently |
| **Include examples** | Real usage examples aid understanding | Add `@example calculateTax(100, 0.2) // returns 20` |
| **Keep docs updated** | Regenerate when code changes significantly | "Update the docstring to reflect the new error handling" |

### Refining Suggestions

| Practice | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Never accept blindly** | Always review before accepting | Check that a sorting function handles empty arrays before using it |
| **Iterate incrementally** | Build up complexity through refinements | Start with basic search, then add filtering, then add pagination |
| **Request alternatives** | Compare different approaches | "Show me 2-3 ways to implement caching for this function" |
| **Test thoroughly** | Verify correctness with unit tests | "Generate Jest tests covering edge cases for this function" |
| **Apply standards** | Ensure alignment with team conventions | "Refactor to follow our error handling pattern with Result objects" |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Copilot excels at documentation** - Use it to generate JSDoc, README files, and API docs
2. **Instruction files reduce rework** - Encoding team standards means Copilot's first suggestion is closer to production quality
3. **Prompt files standardise workflows** - Reusable templates give the whole team consistent documentation, review, and debugging processes
4. **Custom agents scope the experience** - A docs-writer agent or review agent bundles the right tools and instructions for the task
5. **Agent skills package domain workflows** - Use skills when a team repeats the same multi-step guidance often
6. **Diagnostics reduce guesswork** - Use `/troubleshoot`, Agent Debug, or customisation diagnostics to understand what Copilot used
7. **Review before accepting** - Every suggestion needs human verification
8. **Iterate to improve** - Start simple, then refine progressively
9. **Debug with context** - Provide error messages and context for better debugging help
