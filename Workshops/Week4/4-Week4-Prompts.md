---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Generation

CI/CD pipeline generation creates automated workflows for build, test, and deployment processes.

- Use structured prompts with specific requirements for pipeline steps
- Define triggers, job dependencies, and artifacts
- Create multi-stage pipelines with deployment environments
- Include validation jobs and parallel execution strategies

### Example Prompts

#### Basic CI Pipeline

```text
Create a GitHub Actions workflow for a Node.js 22 application that:
- Triggers on push to main and pull requests
- Runs on ubuntu-latest
- Includes steps for: checkout, setup Node.js with caching, install dependencies, run linter, run tests with coverage, and build
- Uses least-privilege `permissions`, concurrency, and maintained actions
- Uploads test coverage with the current artifact action version
```

#### Multi-Stage Pipeline with Deployment

```text
Generate a GitHub Actions workflow with:
- A build job that compiles the application and runs tests
- A staging deployment job that runs only on main branch after tests pass
- Uses environment: staging with required approval
- Deploys to Azure App Service
- Sends a Slack notification on completion that summarises the build and deploy results using `needs.<job_id>.result`
```

#### Validation Job with Dependencies

```text
Add a validation job to my GitHub Actions workflow that runs first and includes:
- YAML linting with yamllint
- Security scanning with npm audit
- Dockerfile linting with hadolint
- Secret detection with trufflehog
The other jobs should depend on this validation passing.

If needed, install yamllint in the job using `python3 -m pip install yamllint`.
```

#### Platform-Specific Pipelines

```text
Create a GitLab CI pipeline for a Python application that:
- Runs tests in parallel across Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Generates coverage reports
- Deploys to staging on merge to main
- Uses Docker images for consistency
```

> **Tip:** Be specific about trigger conditions, job dependencies, and artifacts to ensure proper workflow orchestration. These prompts work in VS Code Chat and Copilot CLI. Try both to find your preferred workflow.

---

#### From the CLI

```bash
# Generate and save a pipeline directly
copilot -p "Create a GitHub Actions workflow for a Node.js 22 app with least-privilege permissions, build, test, lint, coverage, concurrency, and artifact upload v4 or later" > .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Generate and create a PR in one flow
copilot
> Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for this repo with build, test, and deploy stages
> /delegate
```

---

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code prompts create Docker configurations, Kubernetes manifests, and cloud templates.

- Specify infrastructure requirements with security best practices
- Include environment configuration and resource optimisation
- Create multi-stage Docker builds for production
- Generate Kubernetes manifests with health checks and autoscaling
- Build Terraform/CloudFormation templates with proper security groups

### Example Prompts

#### Optimised Dockerfile

```text
Create a production Dockerfile for a Node.js Express application that:
- Uses multi-stage build for smaller image size
- Runs as non-root user for security
- Only copies production dependencies
- Installs dependencies with `npm ci --omit=dev`
- Includes health check
- Uses node:20-alpine as base
- Application runs on port 3000
```

#### Docker Compose for Development

```text
Create a docker-compose.yml for local development with:
- Node.js application service with hot reload (volume mounts)
- PostgreSQL database with persistent volume
- Redis for caching
- Proper environment variables
- Network configuration for service communication
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment

```text
Generate Kubernetes manifests for a Node.js microservice including:
- Deployment with 3 replicas and health checks
- Service for load balancing
- ConfigMap for environment variables
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU
- Resource limits and requests
```

#### Terraform Infrastructure

```text
Create a Terraform configuration for AWS that provisions:
- VPC with public and private subnets across 2 availability zones
- Application Load Balancer
- ECS cluster with Fargate for containerised applications
- RDS PostgreSQL database in private subnet
- Security groups with least-privilege access
```

#### Environment-Specific Configuration

```text
Generate a Helm values file for production deployment with:
- High availability (5 replicas)
- Resource limits: CPU 1000m, Memory 2Gi
- Production database connection string
- Horizontal autoscaling configuration
- Rolling update strategy
```

> **Tip:** Always include security considerations (non-root users, resource limits, health checks) in IaC prompts.

---

#### From the CLI

```bash
copilot
> /cwd ./infrastructure
> /add-dir ./src
> Create a production Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml for local dev,
>   K8s deployment with HPA, and Terraform module for Azure App Service.
>   Ensure all configs reference port 3000 and are consistent.
> /delegate
```

---

## 3. Test Generation

Test generation creates comprehensive test suites with proper coverage and edge case handling.

- Specify test framework and coverage requirements
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Generate unit tests, integration tests, and parameterised tests
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Test async functions and error scenarios

### Example Prompts

#### Unit Tests for Existing Code

```text
Generate comprehensive unit tests for this calculateTotal function using Jest. Include:
- Happy path with valid items
- Edge cases (empty array, null, undefined)
- Boundary conditions (zero prices, large numbers)
- Mock external dependencies
```

#### Test Suite with High Coverage

```text
Create a complete Jest test suite for the UserService class that:
- Tests all public methods
- Achieves >90% code coverage
- Uses proper mocking for database calls
- Includes setup and teardown
- Tests error scenarios
```

#### Parameterised Tests

```text
Generate parameterised tests for the validateEmail function using Jest's test.each:
- Test valid email formats (standard, with +, with subdomains)
- Test invalid formats (missing @, missing domain, special chars)
- Use descriptive test names for each case
- Use `%p` placeholders in the test name to handle non-integer inputs
```

#### Integration Tests

```text
Create integration tests for the API endpoint /api/users using supertest and Jest:
- Test successful user creation (POST)
- Test retrieving users (GET)
- Test authentication requirements
- Test validation errors
- Setup test database and cleanup
```

#### Async Function Tests

```text
Write Jest tests for this async fetchUserData function that:
- Tests successful data retrieval
- Tests network errors
- Tests timeout scenarios
- Uses async/await syntax
- Mocks the fetch API
```

> **Tip:** Specify the test framework and what should be mocked to get tests that match your project structure.

---

#### From the CLI

```bash
# Generate tests for a specific file
copilot --allow-all-tools -p "Read src/utils/calculator.js and generate comprehensive Jest tests with >90% branch coverage" > tests/calculator.test.js

# Run tests and fix failures in one pass
copilot --allow-all-tools -p "Run npm test, analyse any failures, fix the code, and run tests again until they pass"
```

---

## 4. Validation and Security Scanning

Validation and security scanning creates pre-deployment checks to catch issues early in the pipeline.

- Create validation scripts for environment variables and connections
- Integrate security scanning tools (npm audit, Trivy, CodeQL)
- Add configuration linting for YAML, Dockerfile, and Terraform
- Implement secret detection in CI pipelines
- Fail builds early when issues are detected

### Example Prompts

#### YAML File Validation

```text
Write a shell script to validate all YAML files in a directory and report any syntax errors.
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# YAML Validation Script
# Validates all YAML files in the specified directory

DIRECTORY="${1:-.}"
ERRORS=0

echo "Validating YAML files in: $DIRECTORY"
echo "=================================="

# Use process substitution to avoid subshell so ERRORS persists
while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
    echo -n "Checking $file... "
    
    # Use a fixed Python command and pass the filename as an argument to avoid code injection through file names
    if python3 -c 'import sys, yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))' "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "✓ Valid"
    else
        echo "✗ Invalid"
        python3 -c 'import sys, yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))' "$file" 2>&1 || true
        ERRORS=$((ERRORS + 1))
    fi
done < <(find "$DIRECTORY" \( -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" \) -print0)

echo "=================================="
echo "Validation complete. Errors found: $ERRORS"

exit $ERRORS
```

#### Environment Variable Check

```text
Create a script that verifies all required environment variables are set before deployment.
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Environment Variable Validation Script

REQUIRED_VARS=(
    "DATABASE_URL"
    "API_KEY"
    "NODE_ENV"
    "PORT"
)

MISSING=0

echo "Checking required environment variables..."
echo "=========================================="

for var in "${REQUIRED_VARS[@]}"; do
    if [ -z "${!var}" ]; then
        echo "✗ Missing: $var"
        MISSING=$((MISSING + 1))
    else
        echo "✓ Set: $var"
    fi
done

echo "=========================================="

if [ $MISSING -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: $MISSING required variable(s) not set"
    exit 1
else
    echo "All required variables are set"
    exit 0
fi
```

#### CI Pipeline Validation Steps

```text
Add validation steps to a GitHub Actions workflow that check YAML syntax, Dockerfile best practices, and security vulnerabilities.
```

**Expected Output:**
```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate YAML files
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install yamllint
          yamllint -d relaxed .

      - name: Lint Dockerfile
        uses: hadolint/hadolint-action@54c9adbab1582c2ef04b2016b760714a4bfde3cf # v3.1.0
        with:
          dockerfile: Dockerfile

      - name: Check for secrets in code
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@7c0734f987ad0bb30ee8da210773b800ee2016d3 # v3.93.4
        with:
          path: ./
          extra_args: --only-verified

      - name: Security audit - npm
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high

      - name: Validate Kubernetes manifests
        run: |
          curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
          chmod +x kubectl
          ./kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/ -R
```

#### Pre-Deployment Validation Script

```text
Create a Node.js validation script that checks:
- All required environment variables are set
- Database connection is successful
- External API dependencies are reachable
- Configuration files are valid JSON/YAML
- Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
```

#### Security Scanning Integration

```text
Add to my GitHub Actions workflow:
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Trivy for container image scanning
- SAST scanning with CodeQL
- License compliance checking
- Fail the build if high severity issues found
```

#### Secure Workflow Review

```text
Review this GitHub Actions workflow for:
- Overly broad `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
- Unsafe use of pull request input in shell commands
- Unpinned or stale third-party actions
- Missing concurrency controls
- Missing protected environments for deployment
- Long-lived cloud secrets that could use OIDC instead
- Artifact actions older than v4

Provide severity, impact, and a concrete fix for each issue.
```

#### Configuration Linting

```text
Create a validation job that lints:
- YAML files with yamllint
- Dockerfile with hadolint
- Terraform with terraform fmt and validate
- Display errors and fail if any issues found
```

#### Secret Detection

```text
Add secret scanning to my CI pipeline using:
- trufflehog to scan git history
- Custom regex patterns for API keys
- Fail the build if secrets detected
- Report findings as GitHub Security alert
```

> **Tip:** Integrate validation early in the pipeline to fail fast and save compute resources.

---

#### From the CLI

```bash
copilot
> /add-dir .github/workflows
> /add-dir k8s
> Review all infrastructure configs for security issues, missing best practices,
>   and YAML syntax errors. Report findings as a checklist with severity levels.
```

## 5. Test Optimisation

Test optimisation refactors and improves existing tests for better maintainability and performance.

- Convert tests between frameworks (Selenium to Cypress)
- Extract common setup into reusable utilities
- Create test fixtures and reusable test data
- Enable parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Identify and fix slow test operations

### Example Prompts

#### Convert Test Framework

```text
Convert these Selenium tests to Cypress:
[paste Selenium test code]
- Maintain the same test coverage
- Use Cypress best practices
- Update assertions to Cypress syntax
- Simplify wait conditions
```

#### Convert JUnit to pytest

**Prompt:**
```text
Convert these JUnit tests to pytest with appropriate fixtures and assertions:

@Test
public void testAddition() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
}

@Test
public void testDivisionByZero() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> calc.divide(10, 0));
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```python
import pytest
from calculator import Calculator

# Fixture to create a Calculator instance, shared across tests
@pytest.fixture
def calculator():
    """Fixture to create a Calculator instance."""
    return Calculator()

class TestCalculator:
    def test_addition(self, calculator):
        assert calculator.add(2, 3) == 5

    def test_division_by_zero(self, calculator):
        # Python raises ZeroDivisionError (not ArithmeticException)
        with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
            calculator.divide(10, 0)

    # Parameterised tests for broader coverage
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", [
        (2, 3, 5),
        (0, 0, 0),
        (-1, 1, 0),
    ])
    def test_addition_parametrized(self, calculator, a, b, expected):
        assert calculator.add(a, b) == expected
```

> **Note:** Java exception types do not map 1:1 to Python. For division by zero, Python raises `ZeroDivisionError`.

#### Convert Mocha/Chai to Jest

**Prompt:**
```text
Convert this Mocha/Chai test suite to Jest:

const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('Array', function() {
    describe('#indexOf()', function() {
        it('should return -1 when value is not present', function() {
            expect([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4)).to.equal(-1);
        });
    });
});
```

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
// Jest uses built-in expect() with .toBe() instead of Chai's .to.equal()
describe('Array', () => {
    describe('#indexOf()', () => {
        test('should return -1 when value is not present', () => {
            expect([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4)).toBe(-1);
        });
    });
});
```

#### Extract Test Utilities

```text
Refactor these Jest tests to reduce duplication:
[paste test code]
- Extract common setup into beforeEach
- Create helper functions for repeated assertions
- Use describe blocks to organise tests
- Improve test names for clarity
```

#### Add Test Fixtures

```text
Create test fixtures for the User model tests:
- Valid user data (multiple personas)
- Invalid data for validation testing
- Edge case data
- Export as reusable test data
```

#### Parallel Test Execution

```text
Modify this Jest configuration to:
- Run tests in parallel using maxWorkers
- Split slow tests into separate files
- Use test.concurrent for independent tests
- Optimise test database setup
```

#### Improve Test Performance

```text
Optimise these integration tests that are taking too long:
[paste test code]
- Identify slow operations
- Use transaction rollback instead of database cleanup
- Mock slow external APIs
- Reduce unnecessary test data creation
```

> **Tip:** When converting frameworks, ask Copilot to explain key differences to understand the changes better.

#### From the CLI

```bash
# Convert all Mocha tests to Jest in one pass
copilot
> /add-dir ./tests
> Convert all Mocha/Chai test files to Jest syntax. Maintain same coverage and structure.
> /delegate

# Bulk parameterisation
copilot -p "Refactor all Jest test files in tests/ to use test.each for any test group with 3+ similar test cases. Ask before modifying files."
```

## 6. Cloud Agent, Review, and Quality Gates

These prompts help connect generated DevOps and testing work to pull requests, review, and governed delivery.

### Copilot Cloud Agent Planning

```text
Research this issue and produce an implementation plan before writing code.
Include affected files, risks, tests to run, required GitHub Actions checks, and whether a protected environment or manual approval is needed.
Do not open a pull request until asked.
```

### Pull Request Preparation

```text
Prepare a pull request summary for these changes:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Tests and checks run
- Security or deployment risks
- Manual verification required
- Follow-up work
```

### Copilot Code Review Prompt

```text
Review this pull request for logic errors, insecure workflow permissions, missing tests, dependency risks, and deployment safety.
Leave findings as comments with severity and concrete remediation.
Do not treat this as approval. Identify what a human reviewer still needs to check.
```

### Ruleset and Required Checks

```text
Recommend a GitHub repository ruleset for this project.
Include required status checks, required reviews, CODEOWNERS, merge queue considerations, deployment environment approvals, code scanning, dependency review, and artifact attestation requirements.
Explain which checks should block merge and why.
```

### CI Failure Triage

```text
Analyse this failed workflow run.
Identify the failing job, likely root cause, whether the failure is flaky or deterministic, the smallest fix to try first, and the command I should run locally to verify it.
```

> **Tip:** Cloud agent and code review workflows are assistive. Keep human review, required checks, environment approvals, and ownership rules as the source of truth for merging and deployment.
