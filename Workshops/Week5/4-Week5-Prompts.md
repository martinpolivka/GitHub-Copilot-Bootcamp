## 1. Refactoring Prompts

Refactoring prompts help analyse, understand, and improve legacy code through incremental changes.

- Analyse legacy code to identify code smells and technical debt
- Generate characterisation tests to capture current behaviour
- Extract methods and rename for clarity
- Modernise syntax to current language standards
- Remove duplication and simplify conditionals

### Legacy Code Analysis

```text
Analyse this legacy code and provide:
1. A summary of what it does
2. Identified code smells (list each with line numbers)
3. Technical debt assessment
4. Dependencies and coupling issues
5. Recommended refactoring priority

[paste legacy code]
```

### Plan-First Refactoring

```text
#codebase Plan a safe refactor of [feature/module].
Identify affected files, current behaviour, missing characterisation tests, likely risks, and a sequence of small changes.
Do not edit files yet.
Include acceptance criteria and validation commands.
```

### Characterisation Test Generation

```text
Generate characterisation tests for this legacy function:
- Capture current behaviour (even if buggy)
- Cover happy path and edge cases
- Document observed behaviour in test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Use [Jest/pytest/JUnit] framework

Purpose: Enable safe refactoring by detecting behaviour changes.

[paste function code]
```

### Incremental Refactoring - Extract Method

```text
Extract a method from this code section:
- Create a well-named function for [specific logic]
- Use meaningful parameter names
- Add JSDoc/docstring documentation
- Ensure no side effects in extracted method
- Keep original function calls intact

[paste code with highlighted section]
```

### Rename for Clarity

```text
Improve variable and function names in this code:
- Replace single-letter variables with descriptive names
- Use domain terminology
- Follow [camelCase/snake_case] convention
- Add comments explaining any non-obvious names
- Provide a mapping of old → new names

[paste code]
```

### Modernise Syntax

```text
Modernise this [JavaScript/Python/Java] code to current standards:
- Replace deprecated patterns
- Use modern language features from the current stable version of the language (for example, features from ES2022, Python 3.11, Java 17, or newer, as appropriate)
- Apply destructuring where beneficial
- Use appropriate iteration methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Maintain identical functionality

[paste legacy code]
```

### Remove Code Duplication

```text
Identify and eliminate duplication in this code:
1. Find repeated patterns (list each)
2. Extract common logic into reusable functions
3. Use abstraction to handle variations
4. Ensure tests still pass after changes

[paste code]
```

### Simplify Conditionals

```text
Refactor these nested conditionals:
- Reduce nesting depth to maximum 2 levels
- Use early returns for guard clauses
- Apply polymorphism if appropriate
- Improve readability without changing logic

Current nesting depth: [X levels]
Target: Maximum 2 levels

[paste nested conditional code]
```

## 2. Quality Standards Prompts

Quality standards prompts help enforce coding standards, generate documentation, and analyse code metrics.

- Generate coding standards documents for your project
- Check code compliance against defined standards
- Create linting and pre-commit hook configurations
- Generate comprehensive module documentation
- Analyse code quality metrics against targets

### Generate Coding Standards

```text
Create a coding standards document for [TypeScript/Python/Java]:
- Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes, files)
- Code formatting rules
- Documentation requirements
- Error handling patterns
- Testing requirements
- Accessibility guidelines

Format as markdown suitable for .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

### Standards Compliance Check

```text

2. Documentation: [All public APIs must have JSDoc]
3. Error handling: [No empty catch blocks]
4. Line length: [Max 100 characters]
5. Complexity: [Max cyclomatic complexity 10]

Report violations with line numbers and fixes.

[paste code]
```

### Generate ESLint/Linting Configuration

```text
Generate a [ESLint/Pylint/Checkstyle] configuration that enforces:
- [List your rules]
- No unused variables
- Consistent formatting
- Required documentation
- Security-focused rules

Include explanation comments for each rule.
```

### Pre-Commit Hook Setup

```text
Create a pre-commit hook configuration that:
1. Runs linting and fails on errors
2. Auto-formats code with Prettier/Black
3. Runs type checking
4. Scans for secrets and credentials
5. Validates commit message format
6. Runs tests for changed files

Use [husky/pre-commit/Git hooks] setup.
```

### Documentation Generation

```text
Generate comprehensive documentation for this module:
- Module overview (what it does, when to use it)
- Installation/setup instructions
- Public API reference with examples
- Error handling guidance
- Configuration options table

[paste module code]
```

### Code Metrics Analysis

```text
Analyse these quality metrics for the given code:
- Cyclomatic complexity (target: <10 per function)
- Cognitive complexity (target: <15)
- Lines per function (target: <30)
- Nesting depth (target: <4)
- Test coverage percentage

Flag any metrics exceeding targets with specific recommendations.

## 7. Governance and Agent Security Prompts

Governance prompts help teams use Copilot safely across IDE, CLI, cloud agent, and pull request workflows.

### Content Exclusion Verification

```text
Review our use of content exclusion for this repository.

Review this generated code for public-code match concerns.
If code references are available, explain what they show, whether attribution or replacement is needed, and what a reviewer should verify before merge.
```

### Agent Threat Model

```text
Threat model this agentic workflow:
- Prompt injection from repository or web content
- Sensitive data exposure
- Unsafe terminal commands
- MCP server trust and tool scope
- Cloud-agent runner and firewall controls
- Human approval checkpoints

Return risks, mitigations, and a go/no-go recommendation.
```

```text
Create an organisation rollout checklist for GitHub Copilot.
Include feature policies, model access, data residency or BYOK decisions, custom instructions, code review automation, content exclusion limits, MCP governance, usage metrics, training, and escalation paths.
```

### Metrics and Adoption Review

```text
Summarise Copilot adoption metrics for leadership.
Separate active usage, passive code review usage, training completion, quality outcomes, security findings, and open risks.
Suggest follow-up actions for teams with low adoption or high review findings.
