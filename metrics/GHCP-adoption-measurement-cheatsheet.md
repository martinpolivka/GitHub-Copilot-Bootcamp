# GitHub Copilot Adoption Measurement Guide

> **Audience:** Faculty, stakeholders, and programme managers responsible for measuring GitHub Copilot programme success.

## Overview

This guide provides a framework for measuring whether GitHub Copilot improves delivery speed, productivity, and developer experience **without degrading quality, reliability, or security**. The approach is grounded in industry-standard metrics (DORA) and practical measurement strategies.

---

## 1. Timeline & Reporting Cadence

Establish clear measurement windows to track adoption and impact:

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Baseline** | 8 weeks before rollout | Establish baseline metrics |
| **Pilot** | Weeks 1 to 10 post-rollout | Measure early adoption and learning curve |
| **Steady State** | Week 10+ onwards | Measure sustained impact |

**Reporting Schedule:**
- **Weekly:** Operations metrics (deployment frequency, PR cycle time)
- **Per Sprint:** Team feedback and qualitative data
- **Monthly:** Executive summary and trend analysis

---

## 2. Cohort Strategy (Compare Apples-to-Apples)

When measuring impact, always segment data by relevant cohorts to avoid mixing confounding variables:

- **Organizational:** Team / Squad / Repository
- **Service Type:** Customer-facing vs. internal systems
- **Technology Stack:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Python, etc.
- **Experience Level:** Junior, Mid-level, Senior engineers

*Mixing cohorts can mask or exaggerate results.* For example, a team deploying weekly will look different from one deploying monthly, regardless of Copilot impact.

## 3. Delivery Performance Metrics (DORA Framework)

These four key metrics from the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) framework are your **primary indicators** of business impact. They strongly correlate with business outcomes like customer satisfaction and profitability.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Target / Hypothesis | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | Prod deployments per week or sprint | CI/CD system | 2 per week | +25 to 50% increase | Monitor release policy changes, they affect this directly |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Median time from PR merge to production deployment | GitHub + CI/CD | 5 days | −20 to 40% reduction | Also track 75th percentile (p75) for outliers |
| **Change Failure Rate** | Percentage of deployments causing incidents, rollbacks, or hotfixes | Incident tool + CI/CD | 15% | Maintain or improve (no increase) | Define "failure" clearly before measuring |
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | Median time from incident start to restoration | Incident tool | 4 hours | Maintain or improve (no increase) | Segment by severity level for context |

**Pragmatic tip:** If perfect data is unavailable, start with consistent approximations and refine over time.

---

## 4. Flow Efficiency & PR Throughput (Leading Indicators)

These metrics typically show measurable improvement *before* DORA metrics shift, making them valuable early indicators of Copilot impact.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Target / Hypothesis |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **PR Cycle Time** | Time from PR opened to merged (median) | GitHub | 2.5 days | -15% to -30% reduction |
| **Review Wait Time** | Time from PR opened to first review comment | GitHub | 18 hours | −20% reduction |
| **Coding Time Proxy** | Time from first commit to PR opened | GitHub | 1.8 days | -10% to -25% reduction |
| **PR Size** | Lines of code changed per PR (median) | GitHub | 450 LOC | -10% to -20% reduction (optional) |
| **Rework Rate** | Percentage of PRs requiring follow-up fixes within 7 days | GitHub | 12% | Maintain or improve (no increase) |

**Why these matter:** Faster PR cycles and shorter review times often signal that developers are delivering smaller, more focused changes - a hallmark of productive, confident teams.

## 5. Quality & Reliability Guardrails

Copilot can accelerate output, but guardrails ensure you're not trading **speed for quality**. Monitor these to protect user experience and system reliability.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Guardrail / Target |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Defect Escape Rate** | Production bugs reported per week or sprint (or per deploy) | Jira, issue tracker, incident tool | 6 per week | No increase |
| **Hotfix Count** | Hotfix PRs or urgent releases per week or sprint | GitHub, CI/CD | 3 per week | No increase |
| **Test Pass Rate** | Percentage of successful CI runs on main/trunk | CI system | 92% | ≥ baseline (maintain or improve) |
| **Test Coverage Trend** | Percentage coverage or number of covered lines | CI coverage tool | 61% | Stable or rising (no decline) |
| **Rollback Rate** | Percentage of deployments rolled back | CI/CD | 4% | ≤ baseline (maintain or improve) |

**Key insight:** If these metrics degrade while speed metrics improve, it signals that Copilot usage isn't aligned with quality practices. This becomes a training/process opportunity.

---

## 6. Security Guardrails (Critical for AI-Generated Code)

Since Copilot generates code suggestions, security oversight is essential. Track these to ensure vulnerability introduction doesn't increase.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Guardrail / Target |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **High/Critical Vulnerabilities Introduced** | New high or critical security findings per week or sprint | SAST tool, Dependabot, security scanner | 2 per week | No increase |
| **Secrets Detected** | Secret alerts (API keys, tokens, credentials) per week or sprint | GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning | 1 per week | No increase |
| **Security Fix Lead Time** | Median time from alert creation to remediation | Security platform | 10 days | −10 to 25% reduction (faster fixes) |

**Context:** GitHub Advanced Security can be configured to automatically detect and flag suspicious patterns in AI-generated code, adding an additional layer of protection.

---

## 7. Copilot Usage & Adoption (Proof of Exposure)

To claim impact from Copilot, you must first prove that developers are actually using it. Without usage data, improvements in other metrics become correlation without causation.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Active Users** | Percentage of engineers using Copilot at least once per week | Copilot usage reports / GitHub API | 0% (pre-adoption) | 60 to 80% |
| **Acceptance Rate** | Percentage of suggestions accepted by developers | Copilot telemetry | N/A | 20 to 40% (typical range) |
| **Suggestion Volume** | Number of suggestions shown per developer per week | Copilot reports | N/A | Track for trend analysis |
| **Meaningful Use** | Percentage of developers accepting suggestions on ≥3 days per week | Copilot reports | N/A | Rising over time |

**Why this matters:** Low acceptance rates or usage concentration (e.g., only 20% of teams active) indicate training or workflow gaps that need addressing.

## 8. Developer Experience Outcomes (DX)

Keep this lightweight - a quick pulse check to understand developer sentiment and perceived impact. Use this as part of sprint retrospectives or brief weekly surveys.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Example Baseline | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Perceived Productivity** | Response to "Copilot helps me finish tasks faster" (Likert 1 to 5 scale) | Weekly/biweekly survey | 3.0 | +0.5 improvement |
| **Cognitive Load** | Response to "I feel mentally drained after coding" (Likert 1 to 5 scale, inverted) | Weekly/biweekly survey | 3.2 | −0.3 (less mental fatigue) |
| **Time Spent Searching** | Self-reported hours per week spent searching for solutions (docs, Stack Overflow, etc.) | Brief survey | 5 hours | −1 hour (more time coding) |

**Effort:** Administer this as a 30 to 60 second pulse check weekly or per sprint retrospective, no lengthy surveys required.

## 10. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Risk | How to Avoid |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Mixing cohorts** | Conflating results from teams with different release policies, tech stacks, or experience levels | Always segment data by team, service tier, language stack, and experience level before analysis |
| **Counting "more code" as productivity** | Measuring lines of code delivered, which can actually indicate waste rather than efficiency | Focus on PR cycle time, lead time, and delivery frequency instead, these correlate with real value |
| **Ignoring the learning curve** | Attributing normal productivity dips during early adoption to Copilot's limitations | Expect weeks 1 to 4 post-rollout to be noisy; allow 8 to 10 weeks for steady-state patterns to emerge |
| **Not separating "faster PRs" from "faster to production"** | Celebrating faster PR cycle times while actual deployment frequency stagnates | Measure both flow metrics AND DORA metrics; improvements in one don't guarantee the other |
| **Measuring without context** | Reporting a 25% improvement in lead time without comparing it to concurrent process or tooling changes | Document all major process, tooling, or team changes during your measurement window |

---

## Accuracy & Validation

**These metrics and frameworks are validated as follows:**

- **DORA Metrics (Section 3):** Based on DORA research. See [DORA](https://dora.dev) for the current research programme and guidance.
- **Flow Efficiency Metrics (Section 4):** Aligned with flow-based software delivery principles documented in *Accelerate* by Nicole Forsgren et al.
- **Guardrails (Sections 5 to 6):** Follow industry best practices from NIST, OWASP, and GitHub security documentation.
- **Adoption Metrics (Section 7):** Based on standard software adoption measurement frameworks and Copilot telemetry capabilities.
- **DX Survey Questions (Section 8):** Derived from NASA Task Load Index (TLX) and validated productivity perception research.

**Fictional baselines (Section 9)** are illustrative and should be replaced with your organisation's actual pre-adoption data.

## Next Steps

1. **Establish your pre-adoption baseline** during the 8-week period before rollout
2. **Define your cohorts** based on your organisation's structure
3. **Select your measurement sources** (GitHub, CI/CD system, incident tool, surveys)
4. **Set targets** based on realistic expectations (typically 15 to 40% improvement in flow metrics)
5. **Create a measurement dashboard** to track progress weekly
6. **Review monthly** with stakeholders and adjust training/adoption efforts as needed
